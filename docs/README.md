# Medieval Madness - Technical Documentation


## 1. Intro
Medieval Madness is a physics based puzzle game, created with Godot. This project is my final thesis, therefore the GDD and some other documents might be in hungarian, but the in-code comments will be in english.
ðŸ“– You can find a detailed explanation about the game mechanics and design choices in the [Game Design Documentben (GDD)]('docs/Medieval Madness - GDD.pdf').

## 2. Special thanks
As I am not skilled in graphical design nor in sound design, I've used assets to fill in the gaps in my skills.
I would like to express my gratitude towards them as without their work I would not have been able to create this project.
